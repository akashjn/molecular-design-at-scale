# Multi-objective Active Learning

Active learning algorithms plan experiments progressively as more data is acquired.
In this module, we'll explain the basics of how they work and dive into advanced methods
that help us find molecules that satisfy many design criteria.

## Learning Objectives

The goals for this module are to

- Introduce how "acquisition functions" can be tailor to suit difficult goals
- Demonstrate active learning on a simple molecular design challenge
- Explain multi-objective acquisition functions and their use in active learning
