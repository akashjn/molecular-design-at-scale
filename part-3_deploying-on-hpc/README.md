# Deploying Active Learning on HPC

Taking full advantage of active learning's ability to autonomously design experiments requires remove humans from the design loops.

## Learning Objectives

The goals for this module are to

- Explain how to deploy quantum chemistry on HPC with QCEngine and Parsl
- Implement a simple active learning loop that runs simulations in batches
- Demonstrate a application which concurrently manages multiple calculations
- Illustrate how to re-configure the application to run on HPC
