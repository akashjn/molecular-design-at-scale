    "# Molecular design ML-in-the-loop workflow with Parsl\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a simple molecular design application where we use machine learning to guide which computations we perform.\n",
    "The objective of this application is to identify which molecules have the largest ionization energies (IE, the amount of energy required to remove an electron). \n",
    "\n",
    "IE can be computed using various simulation packages (here we use [xTB](https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html) ); however, execution of these simulations is expensive, and thus, given a finite compute budget, we must carefully select which molecules to explore. We use machine learning to predict high IE molecules based on previous computations (a process often called [active learning](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c00768)). We iteratively retrain the machine learning model to improve the accuracy of predictions. The resulting ML-in-the-loop workflow proceeds as follows. \n",

    "![workflow](./figures/workflow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use Parsl to execute functions (simulation, model training, and inference) in parallel. Parsl allows us to establish dependencies in the workflow and to execute the workflow on arbitrary computing infrastructure, from laptops to supercomputers. We show how Parsl's integration with Python's native concurrency library (i.e., [`concurrent.futures`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)) let you write applications that dynamically respond to the completion of asynchronous tasks."
