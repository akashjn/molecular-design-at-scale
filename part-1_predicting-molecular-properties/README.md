# Predicting Molecular Properties

A central role of AI in our design process is to quickly infer the behavior of new molecules.
This notion of "QSAR" has been around for nearly 50 years, and we'll explain some of the main approaches.

## Learning Objectives

The goals for this module are to

- Highlight tools for working with digital representations of molecules
- Introduce two "classic" techniques for molecular property prediction: fingerprints and descriptors
- Explain the fundamentals of message-passing neural networks
